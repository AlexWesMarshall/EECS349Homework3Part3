Homework 3 Part 3

The annotated assembly code for questions 1 through 4 are located in Question.txt with the corresponding numbers.
The interpreted c code for each question is similarly named with a .c file extension.

Feedback for Homework 3 Part 3
I liked the idea of reverse engineering assembly code to get a better understanding of what an exe is doing
It teaches how to think like a hacker and hopefully give insight into how it's done. Though I was very upset with how this homework actually turned out.
The first two questions were manageable. The third question felt like arbitrary code to throw students off their game.
Lastly the fourth question felt like an extreme ramp up from the previous three with increased work load. It almost feels too big to tackle this quickly without devoting all their time to it.
My suspicions were confirmed today in class when Professor Ye told us that she made these questions with the intention we wouldn't be able to fully solve it.
Her ultimate motive seemed to be to motivate the students to come to class by offering points back in the lab-lecture.
I don't agree with this style of teaching where we are incentivized through failure. This assignment feels unfair and unjust. 
It was also assigned over Fall Break which is supposed to be a break. Fall Break doesn't mean we have 4-5 free days to do Computer Security homework.
I really hope the future homework assignments will not be structured in the same fashion this one was.
